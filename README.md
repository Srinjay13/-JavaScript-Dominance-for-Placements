## 🎯 Why This Repo Is Interview-Focused

Most candidates know **syntax**.
Very few understand **behavior**.

This repo helps you answer:

* “Why does this code run like this?”
* “How would you optimize this?”
* “What happens behind the scenes?”

Exactly the kind of thinking interviewers look for.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `script.js`
2. Read one section at a time
3. Run parts in the browser console
4. Try explaining the logic out loud

👉 If you can explain it, you own it.

# JavaScript-Dominance-for-Placements
This notes for JS includes "Design Patterns", "Perfomance Optimization", "DEBOUNCING v/s THROTTLING", "LAZY LOADING IMAGES", "CODE SPLITTING". This is a tutorial by Sheriyans Coding School, so all the credit goes to them for such a wonderful experience, I just made a note out of the lecture for my future self to brush on JS concepts if I need to !
